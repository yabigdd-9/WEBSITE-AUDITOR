## Overview

Use the search endpoint when you need:

- general semantic web retrieval
- synthesized output controlled by `systemPrompt` and `outputSchema`
- content extraction attached to search results through the nested `contents` object

For most new integrations, this is the default Exa surface.
For list-building and enrichment workflows, use the Agent API (`/agent`), not this endpoint.

## Recommended Request

A bare query returns only result metadata (title, URL, author, published date) with no page content. Most integrations need content, so the recommended request adds token-efficient highlights — and nothing else:

```json
POST https://api.exa.ai/search
{
  "query": "latest developments in LLMs",
  "type": "auto",
  "contents": {
    "highlights": true
  }
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | string | Required natural-language query |
| `type` | string | `auto` is the server default; stating it explicitly is fine, other modes need a task reason |
| `contents` | object | Content extraction per result; `{ "highlights": true }` is the recommendation, not a server default — omit `contents` and results carry no content |

Encode intent in the query itself: subject, constraints, time window, and source preferences all belong in natural language before they belong in request parameters.

## Other Request Parameters

Every parameter below changes behavior away from the server defaults. Add one only when the task requires it.

| Parameter | Type | Add only when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `numResults` | integer | A specific result count is an intentional product decision. The server default is 10. |
| `category` | string | The user explicitly requests category-constrained retrieval. See Category. |
| `includeDomains` | string[] | The user explicitly requests a hard allowlist and supplies or approves its contents. Supports paths and wildcards such as `openai.com/blog` or `*.substack.com`. |
| `excludeDomains` | string[] | The user explicitly requests a hard blocklist and supplies or approves its contents. Do not convert source preferences or examples into filters; use query phrasing or `systemPrompt`. |
| `startPublishedDate` / `endPublishedDate` | string (ISO 8601) | The task states a bounded window that must be enforced ("the last seven days", "in 2026"). Hard filters drop undated and misdated pages; "recent" or "latest" alone belongs in the query, not here. |
| `userLocation` | string | The task is location-sensitive. Two-letter ISO country code. |
| `systemPrompt` | string | The task uses synthesized output and needs behavior, emphasis, or source-preference guidance. |
| `outputSchema` | object | The task requires structured output in `output.content`. |
| `stream` | boolean | The caller consumes typed SSE chunks for synthesized output. |

## Search Types

Use Exa's primary search types as latency/quality presets:

| Type | Best For | Tradeoff |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto` | General default | Best default balance of speed and quality |
| `fast` | Low-latency apps | Faster than `auto`, slightly less headroom for synthesis-heavy work |
| `instant` | Real-time apps | Lowest latency path |
| `deep-lite` | Lightweight synthesized output | More reasoning and synthesis than `auto` |
| `deep` | Multi-step synthesis; wide or multi-search `outputSchema` | Higher latency; runs several searches, so more schema fields come back filled |
| `deep-reasoning` | Hardest research tasks | Highest reasoning depth and highest latency |

`auto` is the server default. Stay on it unless the use case clearly prioritizes real-time speed, deeper reasoning, or configuration control.
`outputSchema` works across search types, so do not pick a deep variant only because you want structured output; `deep` is for a wide schema whose fields take more than one search to fill (see Structured Output).

## Nested Contents Options

On the search endpoint, all content-extraction controls live inside `contents`. The preferred default is bare highlights:

```json
{
  "query": "battery breakthroughs",
  "contents": {
    "highlights": true
  }
}
```

### `contents` Parameters

`contents.highlights: true` is the recommended extraction mode; the server returns no content at all unless `contents` is sent. Every other option below needs an explicit task requirement.

| Parameter | Type | Add only when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `contents.highlights` | boolean or object | Recommended as bare `true`. Object options such as `maxCharacters` require an explicit budget requirement; avoid values below about 400 because they truncate too aggressively for downstream LLM use. |
| `contents.text` | boolean or object | Downstream logic truly needs broad page context. Object form supports `maxCharacters`, `includeHtmlTags`, `verbosity`, `includeSections`, `excludeSections`. |
| `contents.summary` | boolean or object | The user explicitly requests Exa-side per-result synthesis. Each result adds its own LLM call. A summarized final product is not sufficient justification; use highlights and synthesize downstream. |
| `contents.maxAgeHours` | integer | The task states a content-freshness requirement. Caps cached page content age before live crawl. `0` forces live crawl, `-1` is cache only. |
| `contents.snapshotAsOf` | string (ISO 8601 date-time) | The task needs page content as it was at a past datetime (Exa Snapshot). Exa discovers candidate URLs with current retrieval signals, then keeps only pages with a stored version at or before the cutoff and serves that version. Bounds the content, not the ranking. Not with `maxAgeHours`. See `references/snapshot.md`. |
| `contents.livecrawlTimeout` | integer | Live crawling is in use and slow pages must not block the request. Milliseconds. |
| `contents.subpages` | integer | The task requires crawling linked subpages per result. |
| `contents.subpageTarget` | string or string[] | `subpages` is in use and needs focusing. |
| `contents.extras.links` | integer | The task requires extracted links. |
| `contents.extras.imageLinks` | integer | The task requires extracted image URLs. |

### Text vs Highlights vs Summary

Pick exactly one:

- `highlights` is the recommended mode for agent workflows and multi-step chains
- `text` only when downstream logic truly needs broad page context
- `summary` only when the user explicitly requests Exa-side per-result synthesis

Do not stack `text`, `highlights`, and `summary` in one request. `summary` adds a per-result LLM call, so N results means N extra synthesis steps. Bare `highlights: true` auto-selects an appropriate excerpt length per page, so there is nothing to tune in the recommended case.

## Structured Output

Use structured output when the user asks for a specific output shape, or for fields that have to be extracted or synthesized from the pages. They do not have to say "JSON" or "schema":

- "the fine amount each article reports", "name, title, and company for each person", "a one-line verdict per paper" are extraction: `outputSchema`
- "the author of each article" when the user requires it ("I absolutely need the author", "nothing without one") is extraction too: `author` metadata is present only when the publisher exposes it, so a required author has to be confirmed from the page, and results that fail the rule are dropped in `systemPrompt`
- "10 articles with title and URL" is not: every result already carries `title`, `url`, and `publishedDate`, so this is the recommended request with `numResults: 10` and no schema

Three fields, three jobs. Sort every clause of the user's ask into exactly one:

- `query`: what to retrieve, phrased like a search box entry ("latest news on Nvidia"). Test: if a clause contains `only`, `include`, `exclude`, `drop`, `return`, `must have`, it is not query text.
- `systemPrompt`: keep/drop and verification rules, source preferences, what to do when a field cannot be verified (omit or null, never a guess). A follow-up that adds a rule ("nothing without an author") edits `systemPrompt`, not `query`.
- `outputSchema`: the shape of `output.content`

```json
{
  "query": "latest news on Nvidia",
  "systemPrompt": "Include an article only when its page names an individual author. Omit results whose author cannot be verified; never substitute 'Staff' or the publication name.",
  "outputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "articles": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {"author": {"type": "string"}, "url": {"type": "string"}},
          "required": ["author", "url"]
        }
      }
    },
    "required": ["articles"]
  },
  "contents": {"highlights": true}
}
```

Not this: `"query": "latest Nvidia news, only articles with a named author, exclude staff bylines"` with no `systemPrompt`. Same words, wrong field: the rule is now steering retrieval instead of filtering the synthesized output.

Keep `contents: {"highlights": true}` on the request so the fields are filled from page content rather than from titles and metadata alone.

A compact schema (the author and URL above) stays on `auto`. When the schema is wide, or its fields take more than one search to fill (several facts per entity, values that live on different pages), set `type: "deep"`: it runs several searches instead of one, so more of the fields come back filled.

Keep schemas small and explicit. A handful of named fields, one nested object at most, arrays that declare `items`. This is about as far as `/search` wants you to go:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "matches": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "site": { "type": "string" },
          "url": { "type": "string" },
          "quote": { "type": "string" }
        }
      }
    },
    "verdict": { "type": "string" }
  }
}
```

If the ask needs more columns than that, drop the least important ones or send the job to `/agent`. Do not fatten or deepen the schema and hope. Compact schemas also synthesize better. Use a deeper search `type` when the retrieval itself needs more reasoning, not because the output is JSON.

## Category

Do not set `category` unless the user explicitly requests category-constrained retrieval. Mapping task nouns to categories — news tasks to `news`, people tasks to `people`, paper tasks to `publication` — is a mistake: the default index already handles those queries, and the query text itself is the right place to express the topic.

When a user does explicitly request it, documented values include `company`, `people`, `publication`, `news`, `personal site`, and `financial report`. Never invent categories such as `github`, `documentation`, `qa`, or `pdf`. For coding queries, use plain `/search`.

### People and Company Routing

List-building and enrichment workflows do not belong here. Finding stakeholders, sourcing candidates, mapping companies, or enriching entity rows are Agent API workflows: use `/agent` (see [agent.md](agent.md)). `category: "people"` and `category: "company"` are only for retrieving raw people or company documents as search results.

When those categories are legitimately in use, they restrict which filters are valid:

- `people` does not support date or crawl-date filters, and does not support `excludeDomains`
- for `people`, `includeDomains` only accepts LinkedIn domains
- `company` does not support date or crawl-date filters
- `company` supports `excludeDomains`
- unsupported category/filter combinations return a 400 error

For `people` search in particular, push the filtering logic into the natural-language query.

## Streaming and Response Shape

Streaming is currently used only for synthesized output. When `stream: true` is paired with `outputSchema`, the search endpoint returns `text/event-stream` instead of a single JSON payload. Without `outputSchema`, it returns the normal JSON search response even when `stream` is `true`. Robust streaming consumers should branch on the chunk `type`. Current public chunk types are `text-delta`, `grounding`, `results`, `stream-reset`, `done`, and `error`.

Non-streaming responses typically include:

- `requestId`
- `results`
- optional `output`
- `costDollars`
- `searchTime`

Prefer reading citations and grounding from `output.grounding` when using structured or synthesized output.

## Critical Pitfalls

1. Do not decorate the recommended request without reason. Send `query`, `type: "auto"`, and `contents.highlights: true`; add anything else only when the task explicitly requires it.
2. Do not send a boilerplate `numResults`; the server default is 10, and a different count is a product decision.
3. Do not set `category` or domain filters without an explicit user request. Source preferences belong in query phrasing or `systemPrompt`.
4. Do not place `text`, `highlights`, or `summary` at the top level on `/search`.
5. Do not stack `text`, `highlights`, and `summary` on the same call. Pick one. `summary` fires a per-result LLM call and requires an explicit user request.
6. Do not use `category: "people"` or `category: "company"` for list-building or enrichment; those workflows use `/agent` (see [agent.md](agent.md)).
7. Do not use `tokensNum` on `/search`; text sizing belongs under `contents.text.maxCharacters` when the task requires a cap.
8. Treat `useAutoprompt`, `numSentences`, and `highlightsPerUrl` as deprecated; do not add them to new examples.
9. Use `contents.maxAgeHours` instead of `livecrawl`.
10. Never invent `category` values such as `github`, `documentation`, `qa`, or `pdf`.
11. Do not add `startPublishedDate` / `endPublishedDate` for "recent" or "latest" alone; phrase that recency in the query. Use date filters when the task states a bounded window that must be enforced (for example "from the last seven days", "published in 2026").
